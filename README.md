# LibraryManagementUI

A new on-going project where I'm building a **React frontend** to consume the [Library Management API](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/LibraryManagementAPI) and provide a **user-friendly web interface**.
This project aims to strengthen my knowledge of frontend fundamentals (**HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**) while exploring how the frontend connects with the backend to display dynamic data and create a user-friendly web interface.

> **Note:** This project is currently under development and not yet usable. As a learning project, some implementations may not follow best practices initially, but I intend to follow React best practices as I continue learning and improving.

## 🚀 Features

- **Responsive Interface**: Adaptable layout for different screen sizes
- **Complete CRUD System**: Interfaces for Creating, Reading, Updating, and Deleting resources
- **Form Validation**: Client-side validation for all input fields
- **Manageable Resources**:
  - Authors
  - Books
  - Book Copies
  - Categories
  - Clients
  - Publishers
  - Rents
  - Rents Receptions

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **React**: Library for building the user interface
- **React Router**: For navigation between components
- **Vite**: Next generation frontend tooling for fast development and builds
- **CSS**: Styling and responsive layout
- **JavaScript/JSX**: Logic and component structuring

## 📋 Current Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure with some key files and directories in such as:

- [**index.html**](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/LibraryManagementUI/blob/main/library-management-webapp/index.html): Main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the browser
- [**src/App.jsx**](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/LibraryManagementUI/blob/main/library-management-webapp/src/App.jsx): Main component that manages routes and application navigation
- [**src/index.css**](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/LibraryManagementUI/blob/main/library-management-webapp/src/index.css): Global styles for the application
- [**src/main.jsx**](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/LibraryManagementUI/blob/main/library-management-webapp/src/index.css): The entry point of the React application
- [**src/components/**](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/LibraryManagementUI/tree/main/library-management-webapp/src/components): Reusable UI components (forms, buttons, inputs)
- [**src/config/**](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/LibraryManagementUI/tree/main/library-management-webapp/src/config): Configuration files for form structures and validations
- [**src/pages/**](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/LibraryManagementUI/tree/main/library-management-webapp/src/pages): Main application pages organized by functionality
- [**src/images/**](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/LibraryManagementUI/tree/main/library-management-webapp/src/pages): Custom-designed icons and visual assets
